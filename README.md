## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/) - For sliders

### What I learned



### Continued development

- I learned about flex-shrink and flex-grow. I did'nt know how to use these properties well.
By default flex items has it values defined by flex-shrink 1, meaning they can shrink If necessary, in some parts of the code I needed it to change.

```css
    flex-shrink: 1; // By default is defined as 1
    flex-grow: 0; // In some case you may need to change it to 1 and shrink to 0
```

- I already knew React, but working in this project I could study on it without following a step-by-step process and get down to it. I think I want to study more about React as well as I know about Vue.

### Useful resources

- [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/) - This helped me in crew page, and using it I've learned new options in the library.

- [Flex CSS](https://origamid.com/projetos/flexbox-guia-completo/) and [Grid CSS](https://www.origamid.com/projetos/css-grid-layout-guia-completo/) - Here you can find a complete guide that can help you clear up some doubts about these layouts.
